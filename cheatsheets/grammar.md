# Choice of words

* That vs Which 

    That is generally more useful for introducing restrictive clauses (clauses that give essential information about the preceding noun), and which is more useful for introducing nonrestrictive clauses (clauses that give nonessential information). 
    If removing the words that follow would change the meaning of the sentence, use "that." Otherwise, "which" is fine.

    > e.g:   
      Dogs that bark scare me.  
      Dogs, which make great pets, can be expensive


  That is also used for equal

  > We need to show that 2 plus 2 -- that is, the sum of 2 and 2 – is 4.  
     We need to show that 2 plus 2, that is, the sum of 2 and 2, is 4.
 
* Whereas:

    The rule of thumb is: When you contrast two things, use a comma. “Whereas” is typically used to contrast two things:

    > :white_check_mark: I am very tall, whereas my wife is quite short.  
    :no_entry_sign:  I am very tall whereas my wife is quite short.

 # Punctuations
 
* Em dash (---) vs En dash (--)

    The en dash (--) is slightly wider than the hyphen (-) but narrower than the em dash (---). It is used to **indicate a range or connections**.  
    The em dash (---) is twice as long as the en dash. It is in place of a comma, parenthesis, or colon to enhance readability or emphasize the conclusion of a sentence. It can also be used to indicate sudden change in context.

    > e.g.:   
      Em dash: We could not wait to meet them --- we had missed them so much.  
      Em dash: I need to go to the supermarket to buy 3 things --- toothpaste, shampoo, and soap.   
      Em dash: I had a great vacation in Bali --- oh! Is that your dog? He’s so cute!  
      Em dash: Please call my supervisor --- John Wick --- on Friday.
      En dash: You could choose 2 numbers from 1--50. 
      En dash: The red team won 3--1 in this match.  
      En dash: Europe--USA is a long flight.
