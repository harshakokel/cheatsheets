* That vs Which 

That is generally more useful for introducing restrictive clauses (clauses that give essential information about the preceding noun), and which is more useful for introducing nonrestrictive clauses (clauses that give nonessential information). 
If removing the words that follow would change the meaning of the sentence, use "that." Otherwise, "which" is fine.

> e.g:   
  Dogs that bark scare me.  
  Dogs, which make great pets, can be expensive

      
* That is for equal
> We need to show that 2 plus 2 – that is, the sum of 2 and 2 – is 4.  
 We need to show that 2 plus 2, that is, the sum of 2 and 2, is 4.
 
* Whereas:

The rule of thumb is: When you contrast two things, use a comma. “Whereas” is typically used to contrast two things:

> :white_check_mark: I am very tall, whereas my wife is quite short.  
:no_entry_sign:  I am very tall whereas my wife is quite short.
