## git basic commands ##

Command | Description
--- | ---
git clone [url] | Download remote repository and checkout master branch
git checkout --track origin/[branch_name] | Create local branch as a copy of existing remote branch <br> (and set as upstream)
git checkout -b [branch_name] | Create new local branch and switch to it
git checkout [branch_name] | Switch to another local branch
git status -sb | Show current branch, changed files and ahead/behind status
git commit -m '[message]' | Create new local commit from index
git push -u origin HEAD | Send current local branch as **new** remote branch <br> (and set as upstream)
git push | Send new local commits of the current branch to its <br> **existing** upstream branch (remote expects fast-forward)
git push -f [remote_name] [branch_name] | The same, but with forced overwrite and explicit names. <br> Warning: remote branch tip overwriting
git fetch | Download new commits of all remote branches without merging <br> (updating references 'origin/branch_name')
git fetch --tags | The same, but with tags as well
git pull | Download and merge new commits to the current branch from its <br> upstream (fast-forward possible here)
git pull --rebase | The same, but using rebase instead of merge
git branch -d [branch_name] | Delete local branch
git branch -D [branch_name] | The same, but force
git push origin --delete [branch_name] | Delete remote branch in remote repository
git init | Initialize current directory as a new empty git repository
git remote set-url [remote_name] [remote_url] | Change remote
git config --global credential.helper store | To update the password on terminal, use this command before git pull
git clone --recursive [repo url] | To clone submodules while cloning main repo
git submodule update --remote | to update the submodules
git submodule sync | to sync .gitmodules with .gitconfig 


Note: you interact with remote repository only in case of 'clone', 'fetch', 'pull' or 'push', all other operations are local and don't need network connection


## git terms ##

Term | Description
--- | ---
repository | Your project's folder under version control, it contains hidden `.git` folder and may contain `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files
bare repository | Repository without working copy (no checkout possible). Typical server repository
commit | Fixed (immutable) snapshot which describes complete and certain state of the project (not changeset!) referring entire previous snapshot history. It has unique hash, arbitrary message, author, committer, author date, commit date and references its parent commits
[commit_hash] | Unique identifier of any commit, the principal way to refer certain project state. <br> Looks like f5b5e37, which is a short form - just a unique substring of full value <br> f5b5e3719202bc5a78d97fc48aa089ca3034ce04 - calculated as SHA-1 hash from every data mentioned above
changeset&nbsp;(changes,&nbsp;diff) | A set of changes. Always dynamically calculated difference between two certain project states. When you watch a commit - it's a difference against its previous commit (direct parent). In case of watching index (staging) - against last commit. And unstaged changes - is a changeset between index and working copy.
branch | An independent line of development which "grows" by appending new commits
branch tip (head) | Is a last commit of the branch. <br> The tip of local branch gets promoted by performing commit and pull. <br> Whereas tip of remote branch - by fetch and push
[branch_name] | Just a reference to branch tip (local or remote). <br> Typically consists of two parts with jira ticket id <br> ('feature/ASD-4385-shop-workflow', 'bugfix/ASD-4512', 'origin/bugfix/ASD-4512')
working copy (tree) | Your current state of files, it's what you see and edit. HEAD + uncommitted changes
HEAD | Automatic reference to the current (base, last) commit. Typically the tip of current branch.
detached HEAD | When your HEAD is not a tip of any branch (after checking out arbitrary commit)
to checkout | Make working copy (and HEAD) represent given commit (typically by branch name)
[remote_name] | Remote repository (by default you have only one named 'origin')
remote branch | Remote repository branch, works as a local reference to its last known position (commit), always contains remote prefix ('origin/develop')
upstream (or remote-tracking) branch | Linked remote branch, typically with the same name: <br> 'origin/bugfix/ASD-4512', to push/pull local branch commits from
master branch | The only branch existing in every git repository from the beginning, <br> typically holds production-ready code
develop branch | Permanent branch with latest developed features for the next release
feature branch | Temporary branch for separate developing of specific feature
release branch | Temporary branch targeting preparation of specific release 
hotfix branch | Temporary branch just for fixing bug found on production
tag | Fixed reference to the fixed commit, <br> typically to mark certain release, like 'v1.8.5-rc2'
index <br> (staged files, staging area) | Next commit will be created from this set of changes
ahead 3 / behind 5 | Amount of unique new commits in comparison with upstream, <br> ahead 3 - is yours, behind 5 - in upstream. All others are common.
to merge | Integrate another branch into current branch
merge commit | Commit with two parent commits (first - direct one and second - tip of merged branch). <br> Should contain correct union of both.
evil merge | Merge that introduces unique changes that don't appear in any parents.
merge conflict | The situation during merge when same lines of code were changed concurrently and differently, so git can't merge them automatically.
fast-forward | Special case of merge, when you merge commits from another branch <br> into your current branch, and your branch is completely behind it (ahead is 0, behind > 0), <br> there is no need in merge commit, current branch tip is just moved forward. But there is an option to create merge commit anyway.
to amend commit | Recreate last commit as a new commit in order to append more changes or fix its message. <br> Warning: if commit has been pushed and used by other developer, don't do amend
to rebase | Place current branch on the top of another branch. Rebase will replay (recreate) commits as if branch has been started from another project state. Technically for every commit it takes its changeset and applies on the top (so conflicts are possible). <br> Warning: if branch has been pushed and used by other developer, don't do rebase
pull request | TO DESCRIBE
fork | TO DESCRIBE
gitflow workflow | TO DESCRIBE
dangling&nbsp;(orphan,&nbsp;lost) commit | Commit that isn't referenced by any branch or tag (not visible in gui client), <br> but still visible through 'git reflog' and 'git fsck' until garbage collection. <br> Can be restored by 'git merge [commit_hash]' or 'git reset --hard [commit_hash]' or by creating new branch for that commit
patch | A single set of changes (typically output of git diff) exported to text file
git object | Immutable unit of repository storage (commit, tag, tree or blob). <br> Blob is file contents, tree is folder contents.

read leftCount rightCount <<< $(git rev-list --left-right --count $left...$right); echo;\
echo "left '$left' contains $leftCount unique commits" ;\
echo "right '$right' contains $rightCount unique commits" ;\
if [[ $leftCount > 0 && $rightCount == 0 ]]; then echo "so right is parent for left";\
elif [[ $leftCount == 0 && $rightCount > 0 ]]; then echo "so left is parent for right";\
else echo "so they don't refer one another";fi
```

### Git duplicate a repo


1. Create a bare clone of the repository.
```
$ git clone --bare https://github.com/exampleuser/old-repository.git
```

2. Mirror-push to the new repository.
```
$ cd old-repository
$ git push --mirror https://github.com/exampleuser/new-repository.git
```

3. Remove the temporary local repository you created earlier.
```
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf old-repository
```

## git tips ##
* Because [commit_hash], [branch_name], HEAD, etc. are just only references, you can use one in place of another
* Local branches, remote branches, remote urls are stored as easy-to-edit text files in .git folder
* You can clone (instead of just copy) your local repo into another local folder (and probably fix origin after it)
* You can add one existing local repo as a remote for another
* Before performing some operations (like big rebase) do create and store a separate backup branch
* Close and open gui client if no changes visible there
* Press TAB to autocomplete commands, their options, branch names (may be you need to set it up)
* You can use git aliases - [example](https://github.com/capslocky/my-git-config#aliases)
* How to exit vim text editor: with saving changes - just type [ESC :wq], without saving [ESC :q!]
* Prefer SSD over HDD to boost git operation performance
* You can use git hooks - scripts that executed automatically before/after commit, push or receive occurs
* `git help`, `git help pull` - embedded documentation
* `GIT_TRACE=1` - enable git tracing (there are others like `GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1`)
* Typically you need only high-level commands (aka porcelain). But there also plumbing (low-level) commands, which allow you to implement much more advanced scenarios


## why use git shell? ##
* You just can't do most of operations with gui client
* You don't have to stop using your gui client, because shell greatly complements any gui client
* It is the fastest way in many everyday cases
* Much less chance to involve your repo into 'bad' state and much easier to fix it
* You always have the shell and can rely on it
* You can introduce aliases and scripts for frequent operations
* You directly interact with repository (useful shell output, no gui bugs or stuck)
* You better understand how git works and get more 'aha!' moments 
* You will be cool


## interesting things about git ##
* Git was created by Linus Torvalds back in 2005 for Linux kernel development collaboration specifically
* Repository can have more than 1 root (inital) commit, there are 4 in Linux kernel
* Octopus merge is a merge from more than 2 parent commits, it inspired octocat - mascot of GitHub
* Official git manual starts with line 'git - the stupid content tracker'
