# Types of biases

1. **Correspondence Bias**: Drawing conclusions about someone's character from their behavior without considering situational factors that may influence their behavior.
1. **Attribute Substitution**: The tendency to substitute an easier but inaccurate judgment in place of a more complex judgment requiring more energy.
1. **Confirmation Bias**: The tendency to selectively search for, interpret, and recall information that confirms oneâ€™s pre-existing beliefs. These beliefs persist and get stronger even when presented with contradicting evidence.
1. **Anchoring**: The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information received, with subsequent judgments adjusting around the first data point.
1. **Prejudice**: Thoughts and/or opinions about certain people or groups that have no basis in reason or previous experience (from the Latin praeiudicium: prior judgment).
1. **Bigotry**: When a stubborn adherence to strong opinions fuels intolerance towards people who hold opposing opinions.
1. **Stereotype**: When certain attributes are assigned to a group of people who share a common characteristic.
